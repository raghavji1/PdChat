Here's a summary of how it works:

Imports: The code imports necessary libraries and modules such as Streamlit,
langchain for natural language processing, Google's Generative AI model for conversational responses,
and other supporting libraries like dotenv for environment variables.

Environment Setup: It sets up environment variables, including API keys,
which are used for accessing external services like Pinecone vector store (though it's commented out in the code).

Embeddings: Initializes SentenceTransformer embeddings for converting text data into numerical vectors.

Function Definitions:

get_vectorstore():
Retrieves a vector store from Pinecone, though it's not used in the current code.
get_context_retriever_chain(vector_store):
Creates a retriever chain to retrieve relevant documents based on the conversation context.
get_conversational_rag_chain(retriever_chain): 
Constructs a chain for handling conversational responses based on retrieved documents and conversation history.
get_response(user_input, vector_store):
Generates a response from the chatbot based on user input and the conversation context.
Streamlit Configuration: Sets up Streamlit page configuration and initializes session state variables for chat history and vector store.

Chat Interface: Renders a chat interface where users can input queries.

User Interaction:

When a user inputs a query, the code retrieves a response from the chatbot using the get_response() function.
The response is displayed in the chat interface along with the user's query.
The chat history is updated with the user's query and the chatbot's response.
Overall, the code creates a conversational chatbot interface where users can interact with a chatbot powered by
language models and retrieve responses based on their queries and the context of the conversation.
The chatbot utilizes language understanding and generation techniques to provide relevant and coherent responses to user inputs.
